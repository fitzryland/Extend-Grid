Flex Grid
==========

These are my thoughts on a flexible grid system. I am mainly building it just to get a better understanding of it all, but I think this system could work pretty well. I would love some feedback!

The main idea is to define layouts in a multidimentional Sass list and build a media query and a grid for each layout.

### TODO

* Nested grids are up next.
* fancier, more fine tuned media queries
