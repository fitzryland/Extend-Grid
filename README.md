Extend Grid
==========

A Sass based grid framework based on extends.

The idea is that the grid system is not semantic at all, so it should stay out of your HTML. I took an OOCSS approach, but instead of including those classnames in the HTML I made them extends in my Sass.

### TODO

* pretty up example page
* IE8 layout fallback with something like .ie8 & { @content; }
* need left and right margin to allow for column spacing. aka column shift
